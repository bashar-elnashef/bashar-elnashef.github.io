#   title: "Geometry, calibration, and robust centering procedures for refractive dome-port based imaging systems"
#   venue: ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 2022
#   description: "In this paper we examine the geometry of dome-port-equipped imaging systems to develop a representation in which the non-linear ray trajectory is directly incorporated into the collinearity equations. 
#     Our forms confirm the observations that when the camera and sphere center do not coincide, the system becomes axial. 
#     Yet, we improve on that observation by analytically demonstrating that with a slight modification to the camera parameters the system model becomes central rather than the more involved form. 
#     Therefore, we not only link the axial realization with the commonly applied central form but also explain how
#     to support this adaptation. Our representation and its realizations translate to direct and optimal
#     pose estimation and calibration forms that can be solved using standard protocols. To minimize
#     distortions, we also propose a single-phase camera centering solution."

  This method is then used to improve the robustness, efficiency, and convergence of the solution when used as a refinement to the global rotations."

  description: "We reformulate the ray-tracing problem of the ray propgation through a thick spherical interface as a 22-degree polynomial problem. 
  This we then show can be relaxed to 4- and 8-degree polynomials for which the 4-degree one consitute a closed form solution in constant time to an already highly non-linear problem."

  The methods adopts a local warp model which we improve by adding a global constraint that allows generating optimal warps for all images in a single optimization. 
  This way, the distortions are also minimized globally and linearly in the least-squares sense."
