#   venue: ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 2022
#   description: "In this paper we examine the geometry of dome-port-equipped imaging systems to develop a representation in which the non-linear ray trajectory is directly incorporated into the collinearity equations. 
#     Our forms confirm the observations that when the camera and sphere center do not coincide, the system becomes axial. 
#     Yet, we improve on that observation by analytically demonstrating that with a slight modification to the camera parameters the system model becomes central rather than the more involved form. 
#     Therefore, we not only link the axial realization with the commonly applied central form but also explain how
#     to support this adaptation. Our representation and its realizations translate to direct and optimal
#     pose estimation and calibration forms that can be solved using standard protocols. To minimize
#     distortions, we also propose a single-phase camera centering solution."

  title: "3-D image-driven morphological crop analysis: a novel method for detection of sunflower broomrape initial subsoil parasitism"
  venue: Sensors, 2019
  description: 
  # "By analysing the 3-D strucure and growth of developing plants, you can detect the preseance of harmfull broomrape."
  "This paper approaches early O. cumana detection by hypothesizing that its parasitism already impacts the host plant morphology at the sub-soil surface developmental stage. 
  To validate this hypothesis, O. cumana- infested sunflower and non-infested control plants were grown in pots and imaged weekly over 45-day period. 
  Three-dimensional plant models were reconstructed using image-based multi-view stereo followed by derivation of their morphological parameters, down to the organ-level. 
  Among the parameters estimated, height and first internode length were the earliest definitive indicators of infection. 
  Furthermore, the detection timing of both parameters was early enough for herbicide post-emergence application. 
  Considering the fact that 3-D morphological modeling is nondestructive, is based on commercially available RGB sensors and can be used under natural illumination; 
  this approach holds potential contribution for site specific pre-emergence managements of parasitic weeds and as a phenotyping tool in O. cumana resistant sunflower breeding projects."

  venue: Journal of Computers and electronics in agriculture, 2019
  description: "This paper presents a novel data-driven segmentation model as a basis for organ-level plant analysis. 
  It shows that a point-wise computation of first- and second-order tensors is sufficient to characterize the 3-D data, without the need for pre-defined shape assumptions and constraints. 
  The derived information provides an organ-level phenotyping ability, and the paper shows how this ability remains accurate for various geometries and growth stages, 
  even when the model is applied to noisy data or when the reconstruction is incomplete."
