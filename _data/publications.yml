  description: "We propose in this paper a flat-refractive two-view calibration forms that allows theestimation of the system parameters independent of any scene knowledge. 
  This relieves the need for the establishment of external reference frames and allows to estimate the system parameters through the course of the mission and on-the-fly"

  description: "we propose a method for estimating the global rotations of a set of views independent of their translation and the scene structure for generalized cameras. 
  This method is then used to improve the robustness, efficiency, and convergence of the solution when used as a refinement to the global rotations."

  description: "We reformulate the ray-tracing problem of the ray propgation through a thick spherical interface as a 22-degree polynomial problem. 
  This we then show can be relaxed to 4- and 8-degree polynomials for which the 4-degree one consitute a closed form solution in constant time to an already highly non-linear problem."

  description: "We propsoe a stitching approach for large-scale mosaicing of underwater images. 
  The methods adopts a local warp model which we improve by adding a global constraint that allows generating optimal warps for all images in a single optimization. 
  This way, the distortions are also minimized globally and linearly in the least-squares sense."

  title: "3-D image-driven morphological crop analysis: a novel method for detection of sunflower broomrape initial subsoil parasitism"
  venue: Sensors, 2019
  description: 
  # "By analysing the 3-D strucure and growth of developing plants, you can detect the preseance of harmfull broomrape."
  "This paper approaches early O. cumana detection by hypothesizing that its parasitism already impacts the host plant morphology at the sub-soil surface developmental stage. 
  To validate this hypothesis, O. cumana- infested sunflower and non-infested control plants were grown in pots and imaged weekly over 45-day period. 
  Three-dimensional plant models were reconstructed using image-based multi-view stereo followed by derivation of their morphological parameters, down to the organ-level. 
  Among the parameters estimated, height and first internode length were the earliest definitive indicators of infection. 
  Furthermore, the detection timing of both parameters was early enough for herbicide post-emergence application. 
  Considering the fact that 3-D morphological modeling is nondestructive, is based on commercially available RGB sensors and can be used under natural illumination; 
  this approach holds potential contribution for site specific pre-emergence managements of parasitic weeds and as a phenotyping tool in O. cumana resistant sunflower breeding projects."

  title: "Tensor-based classification and segmentation of three-dimensional point clouds for organ-level plant phenotyping and growth analysis"
  venue: Journal of Computers and electronics in agriculture, 2019
  description: "This paper presents a novel data-driven segmentation model as a basis for organ-level plant analysis. 
  It shows that a point-wise computation of first- and second-order tensors is sufficient to characterize the 3-D data, without the need for pre-defined shape assumptions and constraints. 
  The derived information provides an organ-level phenotyping ability, and the paper shows how this ability remains accurate for various geometries and growth stages, 
  even when the model is applied to noisy data or when the reconstruction is incomplete."
